Final portfolio project for Codaisseur's FullStack Developer Bootcamp.
I did a webpage and content management app for a good friend of mine that works as an Event Planner.
The website showcases her services, displays her past events by category, and provides a way for clients to contact her. The content management (or admin) app allows my friend to easily add, edit, and delete content on the website.

To build this project, I utilised React, Redux, Node.js, Cloudinary, PostgreSQL, Axios, Sequelize, Sequelize CLI, Express, bcrypt, JSON Web Token, and styled components. I am continuing to improve the content management app with additional features.
